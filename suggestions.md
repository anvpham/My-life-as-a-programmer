## Suggestions

> Go back to your original intro "Today you and I are going to talk abooooout..."

Well how can I refuse, ofc I will!

> Hold the camera in landscape mode

I started holding the camera in landscape mode.

> Get a better microphone

I bought a new microphone so the audio quality got a bit better.

> Make Java tutorials

I started making Java tutorials as well.

> Make an audio podcast

I looked in to this and I couldn't find a platform that was free and allowed 
me to upload as much as I need so I will save this and remember it if I
can start to pay for something like this in the future.

> Add a link to this document in the vlog videos

Well this is just a great suggestion over all, I will start doing this.
