### Thoughts

> When you understand the vision start building a framework for it

> You have more power than you think and you have to use it for everyone's sake, the project depends on it

> Making a healthy team is about making a meaningfull connections and letting the context dictate what is ok

### Comments

> Per your first comment example: there is the situation that such a situative  comment becomes obsolete. And then it hangs on there forever because nobody sure if it is still relevant. BTW there is an issue you could do video about - while doing a task  you notice something that bothers you or requires a refactor in a file which does not belong directly to the task. What do you do? In my last job I was ordered not to refactor anything not related to the task.

## Pending tutorials

> Thanks for the video! On another note, could you please make some video (or series) on designing and handling complex Redux store? Almost every tutorial out there shows trivial examples of stores, but I've yet to find a quality material on handling stores with lots of data, or relational-like structure, the ones you would find in big, real-life apps. Any tips would be appreciated.

> Can you make a video about the critical rendering path?

> A video about this would be great 👍 where you start a project on github and show your own workflow (how you search, understand and implement, how you commit properly) 

> I have a request for a tutorial. Would you please pick some documentation, maybe Firebase and explain it. Maybe explain what programming concepts you would need to know to understand it.

> Can you make video on how to configure the workflow between production, development and local environments? Something relevant nowadays in the industry (maybe with Git and Docker) and taking security into consideration?

> Can you make a video where you compare .Net core and Spring boot and possibly reflect on their predecessors .Net and Spring?

> Can you make a video where you show the difference between juniors and seniors with a focus on testing?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
