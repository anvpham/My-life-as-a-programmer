> Fredrik could you please elaborate on time estimates? As of now to me estimating time is like gambling, it's something I find very difficult to get right. Is it just a matter of gaining more experience or there is a more systematic way of formulating more correct time estimates? My problem is that I see each given task as different from one another; moreover, often bugs come along the way, requirements change or increase, and so on. It's not like peeling potatoes, where you know it'll take you x seconds to peel one, so you can have a very predictable time estimate on how long it will take to peel the rest of them. I'd be very glad if you could enlighten me on this. Thank you and have a nice day.

> Communicating with designers has been the toughest part of the job for me. Especially since my company seems to value them more then engineers. Sometimes they make passive aggressive statements like “you just implement the stuff we create. We actually have to create stuff from scratch”.

> Hey Fredrick, good video as always, I have an interesting situation and would like to know your opinion about it. Our teamlead has left company around month ago. Now at his new job he needs frontend developers, and he said that I could join a new team. The company is way better than the one that I'm working for. He said that there will be no salary increase, because it's important for him to know that I switch job for better opportunity, not money. The problem is that I'm underpaid in my current job, because I didn't negotiated my salary well at the interview. If you look at this situation from a company perspective, it takes a lot of resources to hire a developer, and I'm sure that it would be very difficult to find a developer with the same skills for my salary, also there are some risks that the person won't be a good fit. So it's very profitable for them to hire me. Also for me it'll take some time to become productive in a new environment, so it looks like I would even loose a little bit in terms of money. I really don't know what to do. The opportunity for grow seems really good, and it's more important to me than money. But I'm scared that I won't be able to make decent money just because I have a bad start. Should I try to talk about it and try to negotiate? Or it would seem like I'm only interested in money?

> Should I put how many coding videos I watch on my CV?

> Is the security of an application always added at the late stage of development, almost as an afterthought ?

> Is it ok to say my weakness in an interview is that I used to work in a company that uses JSP, Knockout, Mootools on a daily basis. I tried to explain to my project manager the value of spending more time on incrementally upgrading components to ES6+ and React, because it helps new developers who recently joined our projects to get productive faster, and how certain scenarios like updating the state of a component dynamically is much much easier with React instead of the old tools. But I understand the need for a business to make money, and fixing bugs takes priority. It frustrates me to no end, but it is something that I am learning to deal with.

> Fredrick, how do you deal with an emotional vampyrer at work? (As a software developer)

> @Fredrik Christenson maybe you could walk us through your carrier and some stories on those jobs. Maybe your current goals and previous failures...

> How do you do unit testing if the bulk of your business logic is in database stored procedures?

> I love your content. I discovered it while programmig, currently i'm in college and i'm having trouble recognizing what is my worth as a programmer. I have little knowledge about many different topics and i feel like the obvious answer is "you are currently worth almost nothing". Do you have any advice for people who need to define more their career path like me?

> Can you talk about a development job that involves writing a lot of python, pandas, numpy? This sounds like a data development job, but maybe not product development? Would that come to haunt me in my career down the road?

> Hey Fredrik, I have not finished the video yet, I'll add another comment if I have questions regarding the video. Lately I have been searching for resources (books, tutorials, people...) on medium - large scale frontend application. There is a lot of resources for small apps but as I am currently applying for positions on React/Typescript large applications I would like to have a better understanding of the different problems that can be encountered at large scale and potential solutions before having to deal with them. I have been mostly working in isolation or small teams with low quality standards, it's been difficult for me to evolve rapidly (I am working on selecting better companies). This tutorial is a perfect example and thank you for it. Do you have recommendations of advanced resources that could help me ? (I will most likely take bob martins books as it seems that they are a reference for enterprise software but they seem more oriented toward backend software and OOP, I might be wrong though.)

> 1) How do your working hours usually look like? Do you prefer starting early and finishing early? And how often do you work over 8 hours? The reason why I ask this question is that I notice that some of my co-workers start really early, and finish late, so they work more than 8 hours on a regular basis. Although the benefit of starting early is that you can quit early too, I think it might be bad since you will leave the office while there are co-workers who might need your help. So I'm not sure if I should continue starting at 8:30 as I usually do, or if I should show up earlier. 2) Is your employer aware of your YouTube channel? And can that possibly become an issue if someone starts creating a channel?

> In your experience what percentage of companies use algorithm code tests as their interview question, other than FAANG companies?

> Hi, Could you make a video on, what techniques you could use to understand a new big code base? Is there something that helped you personally?

> Hi, question: I'm a junior web dev (9 months), but the place where I work recently hired a new guy that seems to have no idea about the language/framework we use. He keeps asking a lot of questions that are right in the docs or easy to find on google but it seems to me that doesn't make any effort to find the solution on his own before asking me and I'm kinda tired. So the question in question is: How do I teach him to solve problems by himself without being rude?

> Really nice video, hope people get good mentors who think like this. Fredrik, I am sure many would disagree but for me personally sometimes it's very difficult to follow/read the documentation,  it feels out of the context or some particular words  which make the information unclear. Is there any suggestion on how to go about reading and understanding the docs. I am talking about Spring documentation here.

> What do companies expect a frontend developer with 4 years of experience to know?

> Related, but can you make a video on how to deal with low documentation environments and tribal knowledge?  Sometimes it feels like the only way to get information is to ask in these situations.
