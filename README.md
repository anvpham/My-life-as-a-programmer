> @Fredrik, what do you see as best language of choice for backend in the future? Go? Node? Java or something else?

> Hey Fredrik, I have two quick questions.  Is the full-stack developer position typically a small-company/start-up notion or is that ubiquitous throughout the industry?  Also, what do you think about the idea that the full-stack position only exists for companies to save money?  I've come across this opinion a few times, but I have no idea about the level of truth in this opinion.

> Outsourcing : when, why, and how much ?

> I don't know front end development, should I start with backend part and find someone later for UI. How to approach web project? keeping in mind I don't have front end developer for now.

> I just wanted to say thank you for such an incredible video! I have a question though. Is it normal for a junior to struggle with all of this? I'm deeply interested in building and maintaining scalable vanilla applications. I've started and built a relatively simple word game app with only 3 pages, but I didn't use things like template engines, redux and webpack. Now, I'm planning to build a vanilla e-commerce application for free for a close friend starting a small business. My question is, is there something wrong that I'm having a really hard time trying to come up with the structure and the necessary tools to start off? Should I keep going with this, even if it took weeks? I know this is going to give me a very deep understanding of how everything works, but everyone is just telling me to use React or Angular and get it done with and I don't know.

> While writing this a question came to my mind if I may: should programmers ( especially young juniors ) avoid old monolithic projects where the back end code is mysterious? Like could this affect their career/programming because all I say see is legacy atm and I donâ€™t really like this black box situation... 

> Hi Fredrik, thanks for the video. What do you think  is better at this point Go or Java in enterprise application development ? For eg  for middleware application etc.

> Hi Fredrik ! I really need your advice. I will be graduating in July. Unfortunately all my strengths now all lie in Javascript Typescript, front end , Nodejs. I just finished my internship with some Nodejs typescript kinda stuff . The work i have done there scared me so much. My CTO legit wrote a 3-400 lines funtions with 10 if else and i have to work on those codes. I have only 3 months left before graduating. As much as i want to learn Spring framework and its ecosystem so that i could work with seniors that i could learn from, I think its too late now. What do recommend as my next step ? I can not afford to stay unemployment during this hard times. Should I just keep working and applying for javascript role when i gradute and learn Java spring on the side ?

> Hi, nice bath. I was wondering what is expected of a junior web developer? Do they need to know html and css off the top of their heads (they have to learn all the animations?? ) or can they google how to do it on the job? Also, if you were hiring a junior developer without experience, what projects would you like to see on their portfolio? Thanks.

> Thanks Brother Fredik, You advice and answers worth alot  thanks again, Also I have a question if you got some time you will pass by  : "what are the good procedure or practise of release my side project as the developer ? "

> In your opinion what is the best way to find a good mentor in helping me with further developing my skills within JavaScript/TypeScript and/or C#/.Net ?

> (Related to this, could you do an episode on proper error handling? Would appreciate it; I read a lot about this right now and there are many different opinions from senior people. Some say throw, some say never throw. Some say use Either monads. Some say always return undefined or null. Some say do all of these depending on context. Etc... I would love some rules and best practices. ðŸ™ƒ)

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
