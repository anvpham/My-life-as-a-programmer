> Related, but can you make a video on how to deal with low documentation environments and tribal knowledge?  Sometimes it feels like the only way to get information is to ask in these situations.

> Last month, I graduated from high school. I am not going to college this fall, but I could be next fall. The reason I’m not going is because I’ve been experienced with programming for 5 years, not in Java, but in Lua. I’m taking an online course and my plan right now is to either finish it or get to a point where I can make some pretty good applications, make them, put them on GitHub, serving as some sort of an online portfolio, and go on the job hunt. If that proves to be unsuccessful, I will just go to college in the fall of 2021. The hope I have is to circumvent the entire process of spending 4 years and thousands of dollars just so I can muster up a degree that will allow me to get my foot in the door easier. I wouldn’t be doing this if I had under a year of experience, but since I have 5 years of experience, I kind of figured it’s somewhat reasonable, but still precarious.My question to you, Frederik, is that would you agree this is a reasonable approach, given my relatively unique position? I say “relatively” because coming into college computer science, most students haven’t seen a single line of code, and they’ll probably see more lines of code out on the job than in the 4 years of their college education.

> Hello Fredrik, what needs to be considered when choosing between job offers? How much we should value the money itself? I have to make tough decision:a) Company A: higher possibility of growth, more senior developers, company known in local market b) Company B: less seniors, growth by expanding my responsibilites (frontend -> full stack), less known company BUT 25% higher salary. How should I approach this as a mid-experienced (2 years) developer and not-yet settled human being? :( Thank you for your videos.

> Hey Fredrik, great video as always. I need a bit of your career advice. I work at a medium size (~100) tech company. I joined the company a year ago as a support engineer (mostly support and some scripting and bug fixing) and it has been fun/educational but I want to transition to product development. This was my first job out of school. I have done a great job in this position and I think my manager considers me as potential lead in the future for this support team so there is some potential in this role as well but I am worried that there will be much less flexibility and growth than a product development team in the long run. Should I stay in app support and look for the lead role, or transition to development?

> Could you please do a video on how to develop the soft skills. Any book you might recommend. Good video btw :D

> 1. I see many web developers use the job title "software developer" even though they only work with the web. How do you define a software developer, and which title suites you the best if you're working with fullstack web development? Do job titles matter in reality, or do people just call themselves what they like?

> 2. Our codebase is suffering from lack of unit tests. We have lots of complexity in our code which is not tested, on both backend and frontend. And things are only getting worse with time, because of the tight deadlines and lack of time to put into testing. How do we deal with this?

> I would like to hear you talk about scope creep, your opinions on it, how you handle clients requesting changes or adding features and how you fight against it or work with it Fred. Also, do you believe scope creep is just something we all must accept as part of our jobs? Should we expect and accept scope creep like we all accept that one day we will die? Meaning it will happen regardless and we should just make the best of it?  Many times at my agency during the middle of development and sometimes near the end of development the client will request new features or modify existing features that are in the project scope document that THEY SIGNED before the project went into development. This has been one of my biggest grievances since becoming a web developer a year ago. My problem is that usually when this happens the client's expectations are that the deadline will remain the same despite adding more features or changing existing features and because of this the project manager (atleast in my company) seems to pressure you into getting it done without pushing the deadline back because making the client happy is what keeps all of us employed and helps get us new referrals for more work.

> How easy is it for seniors/team leads switch jobs then? Then they will be facing a new team and a new system

> Excellent as always! Can you do a video talking about what you consider will change in the industry after the pandemic? I'm really corious about how it will evolve.

> Thanks for the video. How would you negotiate if you are single developer on a fullstack project (there is nobody to compare myself to)?

> what's your top 2 favourite backend or general purpose languages for the future (excluding php & java)

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
