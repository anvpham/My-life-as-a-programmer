> @Fredrik Christenson Thank you for your response.I was asked about my React experince today.There was a freelance job, recriuter wanted to know how many years I had worked with React.I had to admit that you my React experience cannot be listed in years.Maybe I have overlooked the importance of React in the job market. I have used to do my frontend using WebComponents and a custom element factory library. It has worked quite well, but I do acknowledge that for other developers' sake you should use some standard tools. I have been thinking what I should do as a React learning project. I have one fairly complex spa project that I could take and write a React version of it. What would you recommend to learn? Is Redux used a lot with React? I got also asked of GraphQL experience, so I guess I could integrate that in the project as well. What do you think?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
