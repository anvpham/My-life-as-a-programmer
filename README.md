> Hej Fredrik ! Jag skulle vilja att du pratar i en video om dina tankar om hur du lyckas arbeta med utvecklare som inte talar bra svenska men du ska kommunicera på engelska eller inte ditt modersmål, skulle du se det som ett stort problem och hur kan påverka den dagliga processen. Jag är en invandrare förresten och jag arbetar på mitt svenska språk nu som du kan se från mitt skrivande :)
och den andra frågan är vad som är rätt sätt att hantera okunniga människor eller de som försöker göra ditt liv svårare, särskilt med extrema rättigheter som SD , är trenden i dag.
ärliga svar tack!

> Hey Fredrick, good video, I recently started to learn more about docker and I really like it. But  is it a good idea to use it for development or it's only useful for deployment?

> How would you go about learning how and when to apply design patterns if you ware at around junior level and only employed programmer?

> Fredrik I have one question, how much knowledge of databases should a back-end developer know? because sure, most of us are able to do CRUD, set up relations, simple normalization, and all that trivial stuff depending on who you ask.
But then there's so many more topics to learn regarding scalability, performance, in-depth with data types, complex queries, etc.
So I believe there's a thin line there, pretty blurred to me... are back-end developers expected to know in that sense as much to or close to database administrators?
My question is mainly aimed towards mid-sized and big corporations (not startups), thank you! :D

> Frederik: Unfortunately, I am one of the regretful hires you mentioned in this clip as my employer thinks I am dogshit at the moment. It is 100% my fault but I am desperate to get out of this trap regardless of my future at this current company. Is there is anyway I can come back mentally when I fail basic intellectual tasks and get hit with the remark "You call yourself a programmer?"

> Fredrik, university was challenging and fun. But now that i started working as a programmer i find that the job is to easy and under stimulating, i am so bored with it aftwr 1 year. What should i do? On the bright side i 0 stress in my life now. Its like i have to choose between boredom and stress.

> What are the languages that are big code base friendly/efficient? Is it mostly java and c# ?

> Hi man good content again. Can you give us insight about ORM and raw SQL backend. What are your professional experience about this matter. Thank you much for quality content.

> Hi Fredrik, Is it common for JavaScript developers to use SOLID design principles which are crucial in OOP languages?
Typescript provides interfaces and so SOLID can be easily applied. But is it needed for JS? Is it common to use them?
