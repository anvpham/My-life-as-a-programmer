### Thoughts

> When you understand the vision start building a framework for it

> You have more power than you think and you have to use it for everyone's sake, the project depends on it

> Making a healthy team is about making a meaningfull connections and letting the context dictate what is ok

### Comments

> Bro, what about #cybersecurity?

> Fredrik how much experience do you have in the field ? How do you feel about ageism in the IT industry?

> Question... If you don't mind... Can you do a video on why people dislike PHP? I understand why people used to dislike it, but I don't get it why this is still a thing. The more I learn about Javascript and it's tools, the more I see things that PHP does natively. Great video!

> Guled Why is the usage web frameworks in node js land so low? I have never come across a job post mentioning the use of Sails.js or Adonis.js  It’s always Express.js which I found bit weird compairing to ruby. Ruby on Rails is much more popular in jobs that. Sinatra which micro framework similar to Express why is it like that?

> Fredrik, or anyone who wants to chime in, I need guidance. I've been learning coding by myself for about 20 months plus a 3 month bootcamp, about as long as I've been pestering you in the comment section. I was offered a position as a lone developer for a car dealership. The bootcamp recommend me and apparently they liked me. They want software for inventory that will work with rfid chips. In addition to that they want a customer smartphone app. I'm well aware that they what they are asking for would cost a lot more than they will be paying me from an established software development agency. I'm ok with that. It'll get me a foot in the door and money will come later. What I'm concerned with is the fact that I'm all alone and have no experience. I explained this to them but they seem to be ok with it. Do you think I'm getting in over my head if I take this job?

### Misc

> Are bootcamps worth it?

> Should I Learn Swift or Cross Platform?

> As a software developer, what do you do if you’re not very smart?

## Pending tutorials

> Thanks for the video! On another note, could you please make some video (or series) on designing and handling complex Redux store? Almost every tutorial out there shows trivial examples of stores, but I've yet to find a quality material on handling stores with lots of data, or relational-like structure, the ones you would find in big, real-life apps. Any tips would be appreciated.

> Can you make a video about the critical rendering path?

> A video about this would be great 👍 where you start a project on github and show your own workflow (how you search, understand and implement, how you commit properly) 

> I have a request for a tutorial. Would you please pick some documentation, maybe Firebase and explain it. Maybe explain what programming concepts you would need to know to understand it.

> Can you make video on how to configure the workflow between production, development and local environments? Something relevant nowadays in the industry (maybe with Git and Docker) and taking security into consideration?

> Can you make a video where you compare .Net core and Spring boot and possibly reflect on their predecessors .Net and Spring?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
