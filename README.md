> I'm a 20 year old college drop out who wants to get into either Web Development or Software Engineering. I've been programming for 8 years now but have nothing to show for it except understanding what I'm writing, how to go about making stuff people ask of me, and finding out the answers to stuff I don't know. Even with my abilities I still feel like the either industry wont accept me since I have no relevant experience or a portfolio. What're somethings that I should do to push myself in the right direction in your opinion?

> Good day, Mr. Christenson. I am sorry to bother you with a small request for your advice. I am an appreciative follower of the information shared on your YouTube channel.  I am in  Zimbabwe, #Africa, and I think it's really valuable. I would like to ask for your opinion on WHAT TOOLS I CAN USE to build a site such as https://transferwise.com/au. A prospective client sent me a cold-email and wondered if I could build something similar for them.  I know Javascript well and am decent with React. Can also learn new things fast. What skills and tools would you think I would need to pull this off. I greatly appreciate any suggestions, ideas, and tips you may share. Have a great day. Sincerely, Dominic Mhiripiri.

> Would your rather hire a dev with 1 or 10 years of experience if everything else was equal?

> Hey Fredik, question apart from the video (as always...): Lately I've been feeling the imposter syndrome again because I feel that what I do in my job is very basic in comparison to what I see other people do, more specifically in open source. I want to take the jump and contribute to open source because I feel I can learn a lot, but that first step is hard because I don't understand not even the easy issues. Do you have any suggestion or video about it?

> Great work with your videos, i appreciate your work and has help me a lot this few months. I asked a question before about searching for opportunities during college to increase the "market value" as a programmer. I had been doing my work researching and everything but i came with two alternatives, between finding a job on a company and doing some investigation as a programmer within my college. If i wanted to increase my skill level while not deprecating my future job opportunities which alternative should i try to follow?

> @Fredrik Christenson one idea for a future video, if I may have a suggestion: what are your methods to keep a healthy work / social life balance? You seem to be a very chill person who has it all together (unlike myself, haha). I have struggles with this sometimes if it is a busy period and I know many people who have the same issues. Maybe you know some tips & tricks and you could share with us. Thank you so much for your videos overall! They bring a lot of value ðŸŒž

> I have another question: why would someone want to work for a FANG company? Besides prestige and name, I do not see any positives. But who am I to judge?

> @Fredrik Christenson maybe you could walk us through your carrier and some stories on those jobs. Maybe your current goals and previous failures...

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
