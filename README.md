> Hey Fredrik, Need your suggestion. I have 10 year of experience in core Java. My project doesn't need ninja level java coding skill and as a programmer I haven't learnt much in Java. Looking at the extensive Java stack currently available I have started feeling that it's very difficult to know everything and having wasted my time in simple Java code I feel it is difficult to catch up.
Should I switch to Go Lang as I like back end development ( haven't tried my hands on front end yet) . I  have seen how simple Go syntax is and read  how powerful it is in concurrent environment.Or should I stick with Java and rework my basics. Kindly suggest. I am in great dilemma. Thanks in advance.
