# My life as a programmer

## Description

This is a repository where I can store all the questions and suggestions that my viewers
ask me on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Fidde12345).

## Questions

> Can you make a inteview question video for React?

> Can you make a video about flutter?

> Can you make a video about how to dress in a job interview?

## Suggestions

> Hold the camera in landscape mode

I started holding the camera in landscape mode.

> Get a better microphone

I bought a new microphone so the audio quality got a bit better.

> Make Java tutorials

I started making Java tutorials as well.

> Make an audio podcast

I looked in to this and I couldn't find a platform that was free and allowed 
me to upload as much as I need so I will save this and remember it if I
can start to pay for something like this in the future.
