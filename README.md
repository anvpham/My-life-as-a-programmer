> I love your content. I discovered it while programmig, currently i'm in college and i'm having trouble recognizing what is my worth as a programmer. I have little knowledge about many different topics and i feel like the obvious answer is "you are currently worth almost nothing". Do you have any advice for people who need to define more their career path like me?

> Can you talk about a development job that involves writing a lot of python, pandas, numpy? This sounds like a data development job, but maybe not product development? Would that come to haunt me in my career down the road?

> Hey Fredrik, I have not finished the video yet, I'll add another comment if I have questions regarding the video. Lately I have been searching for resources (books, tutorials, people...) on medium - large scale frontend application. There is a lot of resources for small apps but as I am currently applying for positions on React/Typescript large applications I would like to have a better understanding of the different problems that can be encountered at large scale and potential solutions before having to deal with them. I have been mostly working in isolation or small teams with low quality standards, it's been difficult for me to evolve rapidly (I am working on selecting better companies). This tutorial is a perfect example and thank you for it. Do you have recommendations of advanced resources that could help me ? (I will most likely take bob martins books as it seems that they are a reference for enterprise software but they seem more oriented toward backend software and OOP, I might be wrong though.)

> 1) How do your working hours usually look like? Do you prefer starting early and finishing early? And how often do you work over 8 hours? The reason why I ask this question is that I notice that some of my co-workers start really early, and finish late, so they work more than 8 hours on a regular basis. Although the benefit of starting early is that you can quit early too, I think it might be bad since you will leave the office while there are co-workers who might need your help. So I'm not sure if I should continue starting at 8:30 as I usually do, or if I should show up earlier. 2) Is your employer aware of your YouTube channel? And can that possibly become an issue if someone starts creating a channel?

> In your experience what percentage of companies use algorithm code tests as their interview question, other than FAANG companies?

> Hi, Could you make a video on, what techniques you could use to understand a new big code base? Is there something that helped you personally?

> Hi, question: I'm a junior web dev (9 months), but the place where I work recently hired a new guy that seems to have no idea about the language/framework we use. He keeps asking a lot of questions that are right in the docs or easy to find on google but it seems to me that doesn't make any effort to find the solution on his own before asking me and I'm kinda tired. So the question in question is: How do I teach him to solve problems by himself without being rude?

> Really nice video, hope people get good mentors who think like this. Fredrik, I am sure many would disagree but for me personally sometimes it's very difficult to follow/read the documentation,  it feels out of the context or some particular words  which make the information unclear. Is there any suggestion on how to go about reading and understanding the docs. I am talking about Spring documentation here.

> What do companies expect a frontend developer with 4 years of experience to know?

> Related, but can you make a video on how to deal with low documentation environments and tribal knowledge?  Sometimes it feels like the only way to get information is to ask in these situations.

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
