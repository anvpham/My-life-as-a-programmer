> Hi Fredrik, Background 3-5years developer. Thanks for all your video and advice. I have learnt a lot from your channel and has taken me very far in my career.  I am working with a very controlling boss (narcissistic) and I am kind of stuck, because I love the company, it has a real culture, flexibility and growth etc. But this boss has a lot of influence on the company and stakeholders. We had a great start together as I was one of the first developers and then the team grew. However, I feel I am at the back of the queue at everything, my inputs are ignored, and he is causing me a lot of anxiety and depression.  agree with the importance of soft skills and trying as much as possible to better myself but this boss is not helping with the situation. What do you suggest?

> Hi Fredrik. I need your advice. I'm a third-year student in Electrical engineering. I have done several programming courses in c++.  as for this year, I'm quite free because I'm only enrolled for a few modules that I'm repeating. thus I have been learning web development ever since the beginning of the year, focusing on C#, .net core, EF core, javascript, typescript, angular, HTML, and CSS. Essentially I have taken a full-stack route.  In addition, I'm enrolled for a c++ course this semester that has one project. On top of that, there is an online free (advanced) machine learning course on edx commencing on the 9th of September that I would like to take. the reason I want to take it now is that next year I want to take a machine learning project for my final year of study... hich brings us to my problem. though I have consistently been putting quite some hours, averaging 8+ hours each day. I feel like I have stretched myself too thin. I feel like I'm not making enough progress, I haven't been able to build any complete project so far.  I intended to get a software development internship at the end of the year which I suppose will require a portfolio with a real-life project. so I don't know if the remaining four months will be enough to complete a portfolio, c++ project, and online machine learning... t's quite obvious that I'll need to cut some few things out but I don't know where to start because all of these things seem equally important to me./

> Hi Fredrik. Could you please make a vlog about dealing with nasty employers who won't give you good references when you're changing your jobs.

> Hi, Could you make a video on, what techniques you could use to understand a new big code base? Is there something that helped you personally?

> Hi, question: I'm a junior web dev (9 months), but the place where I work recently hired a new guy that seems to have no idea about the language/framework we use. He keeps asking a lot of questions that are right in the docs or easy to find on google but it seems to me that doesn't make any effort to find the solution on his own before asking me and I'm kinda tired. So the question in question is: How do I teach him to solve problems by himself without being rude?

> Really nice video, hope people get good mentors who think like this. Fredrik, I am sure many would disagree but for me personally sometimes it's very difficult to follow/read the documentation,  it feels out of the context or some particular words  which make the information unclear. Is there any suggestion on how to go about reading and understanding the docs. I am talking about Spring documentation here.

> What do companies expect a frontend developer with 4 years of experience to know?

> Related, but can you make a video on how to deal with low documentation environments and tribal knowledge?  Sometimes it feels like the only way to get information is to ask in these situations.

> @Fredrik Christenson maybe you could walk us through your carrier and some stories on those jobs. Maybe your current goals and previous failures...

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
