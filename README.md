> Fredrik I would like to know how your company goes about giving projects to devs. If there's a project that needs to begin getting worked on do you wait for the right dev to be available to assign it to them or do you assign that project to any dev that is currently available to take it on? For example, let's say you have a project with a shorter deadline than normal and your dev capacity isn't very good. Most devs are very busy and over-loaded but you have a junior on your team who will have the availability but may not possess the skills to deliver. Do you assign it to that dev anyways? Because at the end of the day, the most important thing is the deadline right? And as long as the project launches (maybe with some features that were in the scope being put on hold for post-launch) you can always go back and assign a more experienced dev to that project post-launch to work on it- no? Or is this thinking wreckless?

> Fredrik, I have a question. I study CS and I have seen that passing exams are only about doing some stupid and boring coding exercises and I watched many videos about programming job interviews and they also rely on those stupid and boring coding exercies. If I would make a game or a website myself,  I wouldn't even need that knowledge, and never use those techniques. I thought programming was about creating something... Is this really what you are doing at job? Some boring coding tasks like for example making some loop or BubbleSorting... and arranging arrays ?  I thought I would be free to make my own things... to create something... Did I get everything wrong?

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
