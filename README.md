> It sounded like you're including remote employment as coding "alone" but would that requirement change in COVID-19 situations where most offices are remote for the time being (at leaat in the US) if not longer where it's told as the new norm?

> Hi Fred, how do I correct this decision. I have taken the wrong decision of joining 2  big companies and after spending 4+6 yrs  my pay check is less but my knowledge is very limited if I compare it to my friends. Now I want to switch  but I get rejected because now my knowledge doesn't match my paycheck anymore 😐. So trust me increasing  skill set is the way forward. I want to know how to correct this for a guy with 10yr of IT experience.

> Hey Fredrik. You are my favorite Youtuber. I'm dead serious. I have some questions: I have been sitting on the sidelines of the development community since 2011 and I regret it so much. I have denied coding as my calling for all these years I'm ready to be a part of a team and solve meaningful problems. 1.) As a newer developer, is it worth it to seriously set my aspirations on a career at Google or FAAN? I'm not concerned with prestige or shiny-objects. I just want to solve important problems and be on the forefront of stuff that changes everything. I want to be a part of big-picture innovation and make a difference etc. 

> 2.) I'm aware at big companies devs tend to be a small part of something big and small is the opposite but does that change with senior positions? 

> 3.) What specific companies would you seriously set your sights on if you were a developer looking to get in the industry? And why?

> 4.) Is there any way to find the next big thing as far as a startup goes and get in at the ground floor? Is the next big thing I'm talking about really on a website like Angel List or on a Developer Job Board? I want to find it. How?  I don't want to have billions in stock value.  I just want to be a part of a truly innovative and disruptive company from the beginning and watch it grow. I want to grow with it and be a part of THAT team and solving THOSE problems along the way. Thank you so much for all the effort and everything you do. The insight you offer in your videos is priceless. What you're doing is changing my life. Thank you.

> Hey, not part of the video maybe but what's your opinion about working in freelance projects while having a full time job?

> Hi Fred, just a question that is of concern. I am a year since i started to learn coding. I took on Spring boot as my framework of choice. I have been scouting for an entry level job but most want a degree as a minimum requirement. Do you think i picked on the wrong framework regarding i don't have a degree? On top of that, i remember selecting spring boot so that i could work on enterprise applications, but without a degree, is it possible for me to get a job ?

> @Fredrik Christenson But - connecting this answer to the video - working as a freelancer would'nt be working alone and as so, hurting your career?

> What about full stack vs devops does being a fullstack dev also includes devops?

> I asked myself the same question last week. I met some developers who call themselves seniors just because they worked for so many years but still don’t have the skills I would expect from a senior. Then I met people who have skills and only work for 3-4 years and they also call themselves senior. It seems a little bit like many companies have very very different criteria for awarding a title. Or maybe people just say what they thinks they are  and the company prints it on their business cards. Frederik, do you have a system in your Company?

> Hi, I wanted to say that I love your channel, a really nice, new prospective in the software engineering life as seen from a senior dev. My podcast of choice when I work. Also if possible I would lile to ask how can I, as a junior dev become better at reading code. While writing code is not that difficult, I find reading it quite so. Any good tips?

> Hey Fredrick, First thanks for the quality content you provide on a daily basis,your channel is pure gold really. I have a question, which I don't think you might enjoy discussing or not strictly related to your recent content but I would appreciate your help .i am currently in my final year and trying to generate ideas for graduation project, and it's a really hard task, i don't wanna come up with cheap ideas like building another Ecommerce or so,and in the same time i didn't go the trendy way of learning ML or Ai, so basically my skills are web related(java spring , angular.....) . maybe a little bit of insight on how you handled this during your time as a student or so might help.Thanks in advance.

> Hey Fredrick, I love having you join me for a quick mentorship session with these videos each day. I’ve been a subscriber since you were at 9k subs. You’re doing a great service to the dev community with these videos. With that being said, if your video backlog topics is less than 10 years long ;), I would like to request a video or comment about your recommendations for how to transition from a full-time in-office 9-5 to either freelance gigs or a full-time remote role. I’m an American junior dev with only about a year of experience (doing ReactJS + React Native), but I live in a country (Vietnam) where even senior developers rarely make more than $1,500/month so while I think you normally recommend to stay in-office for several years early in your career, I’d rather move into more lucrative opportunities sooner rather than later (An American junior dev may make $5,000/month while a much more skilled and experienced Vietnamese senior dev makes $1,500/month). Any advice? Thank you very much!

> Hey Fredrik, I have not finished the video yet, I'll add another comment if I have questions regarding the video. Lately I have been searching for resources (books, tutorials, people...) on medium - large scale frontend application. There is a lot of resources for small apps but as I am currently applying for positions on React/Typescript large applications I would like to have a better understanding of the different problems that can be encountered at large scale and potential solutions before having to deal with them. I have been mostly working in isolation or small teams with low quality standards, it's been difficult for me to evolve rapidly (I am working on selecting better companies). This tutorial is a perfect example and thank you for it. Do you have recommendations of advanced resources that could help me ? (I will most likely take bob martins books as it seems that they are a reference for enterprise software but they seem more oriented toward backend software and OOP, I might be wrong though.)

> 1) How do your working hours usually look like? Do you prefer starting early and finishing early? And how often do you work over 8 hours? The reason why I ask this question is that I notice that some of my co-workers start really early, and finish late, so they work more than 8 hours on a regular basis. Although the benefit of starting early is that you can quit early too, I think it might be bad since you will leave the office while there are co-workers who might need your help. So I'm not sure if I should continue starting at 8:30 as I usually do, or if I should show up earlier. 2) Is your employer aware of your YouTube channel? And can that possibly become an issue if someone starts creating a channel?

> In your experience what percentage of companies use algorithm code tests as their interview question, other than FAANG companies?

> Hi, Could you make a video on, what techniques you could use to understand a new big code base? Is there something that helped you personally?

> Hi, question: I'm a junior web dev (9 months), but the place where I work recently hired a new guy that seems to have no idea about the language/framework we use. He keeps asking a lot of questions that are right in the docs or easy to find on google but it seems to me that doesn't make any effort to find the solution on his own before asking me and I'm kinda tired. So the question in question is: How do I teach him to solve problems by himself without being rude?

> Really nice video, hope people get good mentors who think like this. Fredrik, I am sure many would disagree but for me personally sometimes it's very difficult to follow/read the documentation,  it feels out of the context or some particular words  which make the information unclear. Is there any suggestion on how to go about reading and understanding the docs. I am talking about Spring documentation here.

> What do companies expect a frontend developer with 4 years of experience to know?

> Related, but can you make a video on how to deal with low documentation environments and tribal knowledge?  Sometimes it feels like the only way to get information is to ask in these situations.

> Last month, I graduated from high school. I am not going to college this fall, but I could be next fall. The reason I’m not going is because I’ve been experienced with programming for 5 years, not in Java, but in Lua. I’m taking an online course and my plan right now is to either finish it or get to a point where I can make some pretty good applications, make them, put them on GitHub, serving as some sort of an online portfolio, and go on the job hunt. If that proves to be unsuccessful, I will just go to college in the fall of 2021. The hope I have is to circumvent the entire process of spending 4 years and thousands of dollars just so I can muster up a degree that will allow me to get my foot in the door easier. I wouldn’t be doing this if I had under a year of experience, but since I have 5 years of experience, I kind of figured it’s somewhat reasonable, but still precarious.My question to you, Frederik, is that would you agree this is a reasonable approach, given my relatively unique position? I say “relatively” because coming into college computer science, most students haven’t seen a single line of code, and they’ll probably see more lines of code out on the job than in the 4 years of their college education.

> Hello Fredrik, what needs to be considered when choosing between job offers? How much we should value the money itself? I have to make tough decision:a) Company A: higher possibility of growth, more senior developers, company known in local market b) Company B: less seniors, growth by expanding my responsibilites (frontend -> full stack), less known company BUT 25% higher salary. How should I approach this as a mid-experienced (2 years) developer and not-yet settled human being? :( Thank you for your videos.

> Hey Fredrik, great video as always. I need a bit of your career advice. I work at a medium size (~100) tech company. I joined the company a year ago as a support engineer (mostly support and some scripting and bug fixing) and it has been fun/educational but I want to transition to product development. This was my first job out of school. I have done a great job in this position and I think my manager considers me as potential lead in the future for this support team so there is some potential in this role as well but I am worried that there will be much less flexibility and growth than a product development team in the long run. Should I stay in app support and look for the lead role, or transition to development?

> Could you please do a video on how to develop the soft skills. Any book you might recommend. Good video btw :D

> 1. I see many web developers use the job title "software developer" even though they only work with the web. How do you define a software developer, and which title suites you the best if you're working with fullstack web development? Do job titles matter in reality, or do people just call themselves what they like?

> 2. Our codebase is suffering from lack of unit tests. We have lots of complexity in our code which is not tested, on both backend and frontend. And things are only getting worse with time, because of the tight deadlines and lack of time to put into testing. How do we deal with this?

> I would like to hear you talk about scope creep, your opinions on it, how you handle clients requesting changes or adding features and how you fight against it or work with it Fred. Also, do you believe scope creep is just something we all must accept as part of our jobs? Should we expect and accept scope creep like we all accept that one day we will die? Meaning it will happen regardless and we should just make the best of it?  Many times at my agency during the middle of development and sometimes near the end of development the client will request new features or modify existing features that are in the project scope document that THEY SIGNED before the project went into development. This has been one of my biggest grievances since becoming a web developer a year ago. My problem is that usually when this happens the client's expectations are that the deadline will remain the same despite adding more features or changing existing features and because of this the project manager (atleast in my company) seems to pressure you into getting it done without pushing the deadline back because making the client happy is what keeps all of us employed and helps get us new referrals for more work.

> How easy is it for seniors/team leads switch jobs then? Then they will be facing a new team and a new system

> Excellent as always! Can you do a video talking about what you consider will change in the industry after the pandemic? I'm really corious about how it will evolve.

> Thanks for the video. How would you negotiate if you are single developer on a fullstack project (there is nobody to compare myself to)?

> what's your top 2 favourite backend or general purpose languages for the future (excluding php & java)

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
