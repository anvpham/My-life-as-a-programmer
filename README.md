> You talked about how there is possibility that you will be alone with no mentors and you will have to deliver. I am at this position right now. From what job interviews ive been if you have no group working experience you are perceived as second rate. Most of the best jobs are team jobs, so for how long should one stay at this kind of position without hurting your future prospects? How long have you stayed at this kind of job?

> Fredrik hi, In one of your previous videos (sorry i can't find which one it was so posting here) you said that often agency developers don't care that much how good product will work in the long run. They just ship the code by deadline and that's it.
Cause they are not that accountable and there are no clear metrics to judge their work, if code works it works. If you will be owner of smaller size project or product manager and you will have 3 devs working on it and QA (not agency, direct). It's long term project at least for 2-3 years.  How would you define metrics to judge performance of devs / better motivate them ? Is it good idea to have add some bonus depending on metrics ? I was thinking maybe bugs is good metric ? I know there will be always bugs but still maybe frequency bugs.
