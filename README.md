> I hear the term “Anaemic Domain Model” bounded about and I’m left a little confused... https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html You advise that models are to be kept “dumb” and all business logic is wrapped up in services... will we end up with the dreaded anaemic model in that case? Am I mis understanding something, and what’s your experience/opinion on that? Thanks!

> How much refactoring is enough? Rather, at what point should one stop refactoring? I have seen junior devs don't refactor at all. Mid level guys refactor too much (because they are using those ideas for the first time and they are too excited) The senior guys refactor (just enough) to be at peace. My question is what is "just enough" regarding? A video on refactoring philosophy would be good one

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
