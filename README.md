> Hi, nice bath. I was wondering what is expected of a junior web developer? Do they need to know html and css off the top of their heads (they have to learn all the animations?? ) or can they google how to do it on the job? Also, if you were hiring a junior developer without experience, what projects would you like to see on their portfolio? Thanks.

> (Related to this, could you do an episode on proper error handling? Would appreciate it; I read a lot about this right now and there are many different opinions from senior people. Some say throw, some say never throw. Some say use Either monads. Some say always return undefined or null. Some say do all of these depending on context. Etc... I would love some rules and best practices. ðŸ™ƒ)

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
