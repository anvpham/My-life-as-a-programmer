> Do you have a "When am I ready for a junior back end role" video coming soon?

> Question: I had a job application a few weeks ago, composed by 4 interviews. In each one, at the end, the interviewer asked me if I had questions. I asked a lot of stuff in the first 3, but in the last one I just asked for some stuff and that was it. I was rejected. A friend of mine in that company told me that I just didn't pass because the last person was going to be my boss and that he didn't like that I didn't make enough questions. Is this something that happens constantly? I guess it's just an excuse due another mistake I made (I want to believe this, because for me it doesn't make any sense...

> Hi Fredrik, can you make a video on how to  improve debugging skills. I am from Java background and wanted to improve this skill set. There are things that come with time but wanted to know what is the correct approach to debugging.

> (Related to this, could you do an episode on proper error handling? Would appreciate it; I read a lot about this right now and there are many different opinions from senior people. Some say throw, some say never throw. Some say use Either monads. Some say always return undefined or null. Some say do all of these depending on context. Etc... I would love some rules and best practices. ðŸ™ƒ)

> Hello fedrik bro, can you just look below codes and live site in your free time written in css  and I would like to hear your opinion that how I'm writing css/scss code. Following BEM convention, mostly I write classes of specific block like cards__h1,cards__h3,cards__p,cards__p1. Do you think it's good practice. 1.
