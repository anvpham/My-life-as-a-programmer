### Comments

> I have a question that I hope you can answer. When would be the right time to start learning another programming language? To put it briefly, I worked at a music streaming company as a content editor but as the time passed I began learning SQL on and outside the job to make good use of our data. After a while I found myself obsessively researching programming languages on and off and began learning python and shell scripting. Luck has it that whatever led me down this path is taking me from a degreeless/jobless guy to a data analyst. As I become working with python intuitively I do want to eventually move towards something less content-driven and to be honest the landscape continues to confuse me. On one hand I'm very interested in Rust, Clojure and Go but I have little interest in frontend development in JS or backend languages like PHP that are in high demand. On top of all that I do not have time to waste anymore. Sorry for the long rant, hope this made any sense.

> Any opinions on swagger, and how you would make room for it in a node app?

> Merry christmas Fredrik! How true is that "Front-end is as hard as Back-end" or even... "Front-end is harder than Back-end" ? Because the more I learn about back-end the bigger and complex that field seems to be, whereas front-end looks like something you can teach anyone if half a year, I've always seen it as the creative side of programming. I by no means belittle anyone, let me make that absolutely clear, it's just honest pure curiosity :)

> Hi Fredrik, sometime in the future  i would like ur opinions about courses ON Udemy in terms of how they help you to  learn programming if you are a fresher or a junior developer ? Let's say i want to learn something about React, should i self learn it by reading its website documentation or i buy a Udemy course on React ? It it a bad habit for you to rely mostly on courses  on udemy like for your study.

> Hi Fredrick, I have a dilemma at my work place. My manager is telling me my code is too advanced for a consultant team and “I should try to write code as the team does so we can hand off things to them”. How can I vocalize that this is not something that is scalable, time efficient, or useful?

> How to start building your startup idea with not enough experience?

> Fredrik hi, question and possibly idea for a video. What do you think about so called low code (appian, etc) ? Does it have future ? How useful it it for companies / businesses ?

> How would you go about learning how and when to apply design patterns if you ware at around junior level and only employed programmer?

> Fredrik I have one question, how much knowledge of databases should a back-end developer know? because sure, most of us are able to do CRUD, set up relations, simple normalization, and all that trivial stuff depending on who you ask.
But then there's so many more topics to learn regarding scalability, performance, in-depth with data types, complex queries, etc.
So I believe there's a thin line there, pretty blurred to me... are back-end developers expected to know in that sense as much to or close to database administrators?
My question is mainly aimed towards mid-sized and big corporations (not startups), thank you! :D

> Frederik: Unfortunately, I am one of the regretful hires you mentioned in this clip as my employer thinks I am dogshit at the moment. It is 100% my fault but I am desperate to get out of this trap regardless of my future at this current company. Is there is anyway I can come back mentally when I fail basic intellectual tasks and get hit with the remark "You call yourself a programmer?"

> Fredrik, university was challenging and fun. But now that i started working as a programmer i find that the job is to easy and under stimulating, i am so bored with it aftwr 1 year. What should i do? On the bright side i 0 stress in my life now. Its like i have to choose between boredom and stress.

> How can I deal with the terrible knowledge that I am the mediocre programmer?

> What are the languages that are big code base friendly/efficient? Is it mostly java and c# ?

> Will there be any future with complex coding with react and the front end or is the only hope with backend or maybe programming for mobile apps?

> Hi man good content again. Can you give us insight about ORM and raw SQL backend. What are your professional experience about this matter. Thank you much for quality content.

> Hi Fredrik, Is it common for JavaScript developers to use SOLID design principles which are crucial in OOP languages?
Typescript provides interfaces and so SOLID can be easily applied. But is it needed for JS? Is it common to use them?
